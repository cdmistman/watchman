This Go module provides a client for Facebook's
[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/), a file watching
service with support for recording and querying filesystem state.
Two alternative APIs are provided. The
[high-level API](https://godoc.org/github.com/cdmistman/watchman)
is designed for common use cases. The
[low-level API](https://godoc.org/github.com/cdmistman/watchman/protocol)
is designed to enable advanced use cases.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why use Watchman instead of fsnotify/inotify/kevent/etc?**

- Watchman conserves system resources by enabling applications to
  share watches instead of duplicating them.
- Watchman waits for changes to settle down before sending notifications.
- Watchman can also be queried for changes since a previous check,
  or queried for current filesystem state.
- Watchman has been battle hardened by use in projects such as Buck,
  Mercurial, and React Native.

**Are all Watchman features supported?**

All primitives necessary to access the full Watchman protocol are
implemented, however this project is still a work in progress. Most
Watchman commands still need to be mapped to more friendly  data
structures and methods. In addition, the eventual replacement of
JSON ecoding with more efficient
[BSER](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/bser.html) encoding
is planned but not yet implemented.

For details, see [docs/status.md](docs/status.md).
